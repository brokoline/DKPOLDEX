    <h1>History of Socialdemokratiet</h1>
    <p>Socialdemokratiet is a political party in Denmark that adheres to the political ideology of democratic socialism, occasionally referred to as social democracy, which, however, is not an ideology.</p>
    <p>The party traces its history back to the International Working Association for Denmark, founded in 1871 and banned in 1873, which was loosely reorganized into the movement Det Socialdemokratiske Arbejderparti. In 1876, it issued the Gimle Program. Formally, it was first established in 1878 as the Social Democratic Union. This was the formal name for almost a hundred years. In practice, a number of other names were used until it was renamed to Socialdemokratiet i Danmark in 1965.</p>
