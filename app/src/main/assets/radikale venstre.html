    <h1>History of Radikale Venstre</h1>
    <p>The Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: Radikale Venstre, RV, lit.â€‰'Radical Left') is a social-liberal political party in Denmark. The party was founded as a split from the Venstre Reform Party in 1905.</p>
    <p>Historically, the centrist party has played a central role in Danish politics and has supported governments on both sides of the political spectrum, as cooperation is a primary belief of the party. A pro-European party, it is a member of Liberal International and the ALDE, and has one MEP in the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament.</p>
